# Wealth of Nations Project 

## Introduction
<p>This assignment will be showcasing my skills in Excel and Tableau. I first had to understand about policies and procedures of data and as data analysts it is vital to know. I then take you step by step on how to secure your Excel sheet, creating tables in Excel, creating charts in Tableau and then finally finishing off with a dashboard.</p>

## Things to think about
<p>For this project I had some objectives to follow. I had to use the data in the Excel file to create tables in Excel and to then create a visual report in Tableau, matching to the clients requirements. The clients requirements stated that the colours that had to be used was made for colour blind individuals. For the report the client only wants to see the top 20 highest ranking countries only also.</p>
