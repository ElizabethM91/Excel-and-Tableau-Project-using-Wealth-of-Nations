<div align="center" style="font-size: 25px;" >🌍🌟 Wealth of Nations Dataset Analysis 🌟🌍</div>

### 🚀 Overview
This repository contains the analysis of the Wealth of Nations dataset using Excel and Tableau. The dataset provides insights into various socio-economic indicators across different countries. The analysis involves data cleaning, filtering, sorting, and visualization to uncover trends and patterns.

### ✅ Requirements
As the client is colourblind they have requested that the colours that are used for the charts and tables are suitable for them. They also would like to see only the top 20 highest ranking countries also.

### 📊 Excel Analysis
In the Excel portion of the project, I performed extensive data manipulation tasks including cleaning, filtering, and sorting to prepare the dataset for analysis. Additionally, I created various charts to visualize the relationships between different variables such as GDP, smartphone users, and life expectancy. Moreover, I ensured data security by implementing protection measures for the Excel file.

### 🖼️ Tableau Dashboard
After preprocessing the data in Excel, I imported the dataset into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard consists of four main visualizations:
1. **GDP vs Smartphone Users**: A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between GDP and smartphone users.
2. **Life Expectancy at Birth**: A bar chart depicting the life expectancy at birth across different countries.
3. **Number of Smartphone Users**: A line chart illustrating the trend of smartphone users over time.
4. **Top 20 ranked countries by life expectancy**: A bar chart showing the top 20 countries by their life expectancy.
